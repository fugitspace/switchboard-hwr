Documentation from Praekelt on the Redis backup containing event data:

Attached is a file containing a complete backup of the current state 
of the sandbox key-value store used by Kali's account inside Vumi Go.  
The overall format of the file is newline separate JSON -- i.e. each 
line is a JSON-formatted record. It's vaguely human-readable once one 
unzips it using gzip.  The first line of the file is a header that describes the backup. 
The remain lines each contain one record from the key-value store.  
We're mostly interested in records with keys that start with "users." 
-- these hold the current state for each user of the Switchboard menu 
[1]. A typical record looks like:  

{   
	"type": "string",   
	"value": ...   
	"key": "users.+255752004823",   
	"ttl": null 
}

The interesting items are the key and the value. The key is 
"users.<MSISDN>". The value we will get to shortly. The type is always 
"string" and ttl stands for "time-to-live" and is how long before the 
key will be deleted by redis (null means never).  

The value is itself JSON (so it is double-encoded as JSON to start 
with) and contains the following:  

{
	"lang": "sw",   
	"current_state": "cadre_unavailable_contact",   
	"pages": {"cadre": 5},   
	"answers": {       
		"cadre_unavailable": "yes",       
		"cadre": "other",       
		"intro": "sw",       
		"cadre_other": "1"   
	},   
	"custom": {   
		"possible_timeouts": 1,       
		"ussd_sessions": 2   
	}
 }

Brief explanation of the fields:  

* lang: Language selected by the user. Either "sw" (Swahili) or "en" (English).  
* current_state: The name of the state the user was last shown (i.e. 
where the user is in the menu). Understanding these entire might
require reading the sandbox javascript code a bit but they do map 
reasonably cleanly to the boxes in the flowchart of questions in the 
scope of work. Useful for determine where about in the menu people are 
stuck.  
* pages: Some states within the menu require multiple screens to 
display -- this records which page of each of those states the user 
was last on.
* answers: The last answer given to each state the user has provided 
an answer for.  
* custom: These are custom items stored specifically for Switchboard. 
  The meanings of the sub-items are:    
  * possible_timeouts: The number of times the remote side closed the 
    USSD session (either because the user hit cancel or because the 
    operator terminated the session).    
  * ussd_sessions: Total number of USSD session start events for the user.    
  * registered: 1 if the user is now registered, absent otherwise.  

[1] There are a few records that hold temporary metric values at the 
start of the file.
